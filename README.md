# Savvy - Autonomous DCA Agent

An intelligent Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA) agent that helps users invest consistently and build wealth through automated, disciplined investing strategies on the Neo blockchain.

## Features

- 🤖 **AI-Powered Agent**: SpoonOS-powered agent that provides investment coaching and strategy recommendations
- 📊 **DCA Strategies**: Pre-built and customizable DCA strategies for various risk profiles
- 🔗 **Neo Blockchain Integration**: Direct integration with Neo X Testnet for real-time balance checks and swaps
- 🎤 **Voice Interface**: Voice-to-text and text-to-speech capabilities for hands-free interaction
- 📈 **Portfolio Management**: Track your investments, view transaction history, and monitor performance

## SpoonOS Integration - Testing Guide

This project demonstrates three levels of SpoonOS integration:

### ✅ Baseline Requirement #1: LLM Flow

Test the Agent → SpoonOS → LLM integration:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/api/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "What is DCA investing?"}'
```

**Expected:** AI response about DCA strategy with `"demo_mode": true`

### ✅ Baseline Requirement #2: Tool Invocation

Test SpoonOS tool execution:

```bash
curl http://localhost:5001/api/accounts
```

**Expected:** Mock Turnkey account data with `"demo_mode": true`

### ✅ Bonus: Graph + Agent Integration

Test advanced StateGraph execution:

```bash
cd backend
source venv/bin/activate
python demo_graph.py
```

**Expected:** Multi-node graph execution showing market analysis, DCA recommendations, and emotional coaching flow.

### Quick Status Check

```bash
curl http://localhost:5001/api/spoon-status
```

Shows all integration points and demo_mode status.

---

**Note:** This project currently uses demo mode due to hackathon time constraints, but the architecture is production-ready and just needs real API keys. All endpoints return mock data when API keys are missing, allowing full testing of the integration flow without external dependencies.
